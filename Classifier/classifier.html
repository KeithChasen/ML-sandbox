<p>Classifier - function that takes some data as input and assigns a lable to it as an input</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Take picture and classify it as an apple or not</p>
<p>Take an email and classify it as a spam or not</p>

<p>Supervised Learning - technique to write a classifier automatically</p>
<p>It begins from the proble we want to solve</p>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Collect training data - examples of the problem we want to solve.
        More data you have - the better your classifier is
    </li>
    <l>
        Use examples to train classifier
    </l>
</ol>

<p>So we can think that features are the inputs of the classifier</p>
<p>So labels are the outputs we want</p>

<code>
    features = [
    [140, "Smooth"],
    [130, "Smooth"],
    [170, "Bumpy"],
    [150, "Bumpy"]
]

labels = [
    'apple',
    'apple',
    'orange',
    'orange'
]
</code>

<p>
    we need to change all string values to ints since scikit-learn uses real-valued features
</p>

<code>
    features = [[140, 1], [130, 1], [170, 0], [150, 0]]

    labels = [0, 0, 1, 1]
</code>

<p>clf = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier() - that's just an empty box of rules</p>
<p>To train it we need a training algorithm</p>
<p>clf = clf.fit(features, labels)</p>
<p>fit - Finds patterns In Data</p>
